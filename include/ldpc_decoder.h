/* Decode received input into output using bit flipping algorithm.
 * This algorithm is very quick, uses little memory, and only requires
 * hard information, but is much less capable at decoding than
 * the message passing algorithm.
 *
 * (ci, cs) must all have been initialised by
 * ldpc_codes_init_sparse_paritycheck for the appropriate code.
 * input must be n/8 bytes long and each bit is a hard decision.
 * output must be k/8 bytes long and is written with the decoded data.
 * working must be n/8 + n bytes long and is used as a scratch working area:
 *
 * Code             Length of working area
 * (128, 64)        144
 * (256, 128)       288
 * (512, 256)       576
 *
 * Calling this function uses around 50 bytes of stack.
 *
 * Returns true on decoding success, false otherwise.
 *
 * Note that this algorithm is not suitable to the longer codes which use
 * puncturing, as it cannot represent the unknown bits.
 * It's possible to write an erasure correcting step before the bit flipping
 * step, which should allow this code to work with puncturing, but that work
 * is not done yet.
